## Game Description ##

Maze War is a online 5 vs 5 action fps game. Duration of each game is 10 min. The arena of the game is a maze which is randomly generated for each game. There are 2 teams in the game (Blue and Red) consisting of 5 players. Each player enters the game with a custmized loadout which consists of a gun, 2 lethal gadgets, 2 helper gadgets and 2 path tracers. The maze is randomly distributed with 15 items (let us call them ‘coins’). There is container placed at a team base. Every team must collect store these coins in these containers. Team base is where players spawn and also where container is placed. The team with highest coins in container at the end of game wins the game..
